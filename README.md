# logbook
This is my personal programming / learning journal.
I've got nothing to hide!
I Have also written a little shell script to make it easier for you to create a file for your journaling process

Steps:

1. download the logbook directory (log.sh must be included in the folder)

2. to run the script in terminal:

  ```shell
    ~/logbook$: source log.sh
  ```

3. a file with the yy/mm/dd.md format will be created for your journaling pleasure.
